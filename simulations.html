    <h1>Simulations</h1>
    All simulations shown here are using continuous finite elements for the approximation in space.

      <p>These are preliminary results for a Mach 3 flow around a cylinder for the compressible Euler Equations using the Van der Waals equation of state. The computations were done using <a href="https://github.com/conservation-laws/ryujin">ryujin</a> with about 2.4 million Q_1 nodes. This work is done in collaboration with <a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~bgclayton/">Bennett Clayton</a>. </p>

      <p>Here we see the propagation of solitary wave towards a triangular shelf with a conical island and the complicated nonlinear processes that occur after the wave breaks and hits the cone. This is a simulation of the experiments conducted at the O.H Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory at Oregon State University. More details on the experiment can be found here: <a href="http://coastal.usc.edu/currents_workshop/problems/prob5.html">http://coastal.usc.edu/currents_workshop/problems/prob5.html</a>.

	<p>Here we see a solitary wave propagating towards a conical island where
	  the wave breaks (or "gently spills") as it hits the island. We included thin cylinders to denote the location of the physical wave gauges that were used in the experiments. Details on the experiment can be found here: <a href="https://nctr.pmel.noaa.gov/benchmark/Laboratory/Laboratory_ConicalIsland/index.html">https://nctr.pmel.noaa.gov/benchmark/Laboratory/Laboratory_ConicalIsland/index.html</a> We reproduce the case of the target amplitude to depth ratio (H/d) being equal 0.1.
